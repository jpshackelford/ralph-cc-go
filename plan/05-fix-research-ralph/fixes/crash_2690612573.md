# Fix: crash_2690612573 - Callee-Save Register Offset Sign Error (Duplicate)

## Summary

Runtime crash caused by callee-saved registers stored at positive offsets from FP, placing them outside the allocated stack frame.

**Same root cause as**: crash_55976753, crash_785411410 (confirmed duplicates)

## Evidence

From generated assembly for `csmith-reports/crash_2690612573.c`:

```asm
func_1:
    sub  sp, sp, #96          ; Frame = 96 bytes
    stp  x29, x30, [sp, #80]
    add  x29, sp, #80         ; FP = SP+80
    str  x19, [x29, #16]      ; FP+16 = SP+96 = AT FRAME BOUNDARY!
    str  x20, [x29, #24]      ; FP+24 = SP+104 = OUTSIDE FRAME!
    str  x21, [x29, #32]      ; FP+32 = SP+112 = OUTSIDE FRAME!
    ...
    str  x28, [x29, #88]      ; FP+88 = SP+168 = WAY OUTSIDE FRAME!
```

**Frame bounds**: SP to SP+96  
**Callee-save stores**: SP+96 to SP+168  
**Problem**: Writing 72 bytes beyond stack allocation

## Root Cause

This is the **callee-save offset sign error** documented in COMMON_CAUSES.md.

`pkg/stacking/layout.go` computes positive offsets for callee-saved registers, but they should be negative (stored between SP and FP, not above FP).

## Fix

Already documented in:
- `fixes/crash_55976753.md` (detailed fix plan)
- `COMMON_CAUSES.md`

The fix in `pkg/stacking/layout.go` is:
```go
layout.CalleeSaveOffset = -layout.CalleeSaveSize  // negative, not positive
```

## Verification

Once the callee-save fix is applied, this test case along with all similar crashes should pass.

## Related Findings

All these crashes are likely the same issue:
- crash_3051214201 (verified: same pattern)
- crash_184567722 (verified: same pattern)
- crash_1176020246 (likely same)
- crash_1870324845 (likely same)
- crash_145691413 (likely same)
- crash_928313049 (likely same)
- crash_1093823871 (likely same)
- crash_853828320 (likely same)
- crash_1950716464 (likely same)
- crash_23463107 (likely same)
- crash_3253220824 (likely same)
- crash_114128045 (likely same)

This is a **single bug** manifesting in many test cases.
